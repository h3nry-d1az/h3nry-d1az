&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello! My name is ***Henry D√≠az Bord√≥n*** and I am a fan of everything related to **science** and **technology**, from *programming* (as you can infer from my GitHub page) to *mathematics* and *chess*, disciplines that I love with all my soul.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a [small blog](https://h3nry-d1az.github.io/) where, to be honest, I haven't uploaded much content so far, but you can stop by and subscribe to be notified when I start uploading it (if possible, it will be soon). However, you have to be aware that the content of the blog is in **spanish**, as I am a native speaker of it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHcgIehZE12tL777Rx-hHgA) where I upload videos from time to time and talk about the aforementioned specific topics along with several others that I am also passionate about. It's also in **spanish** and sometimes I even bring innovative and well-worked projects to the channel, so I recommend that you stop by at least to watch.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also have a [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/h3nryd1az) that I rarely stream on, but I plan to increase the frequency soon, so feel free to drop by and follow the channel so you'll be in the loop when this finally happens.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, you will have all my **social networks** and **web pages** at the top of the page including those previously shown, I thank you in advance for visiting them.

<br>

<h1 align="center">About me</h1>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I told you previously, I am a lover of **software development** and **technology**, also a fan of **video games** and **electric cars**, although I rarely talk about these two topics on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHcgIehZE12tL777Rx-hHgA).

Here is a list with some of my personal information, so that you can get to know me better:
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on **new content for my channels** and **for my blog**.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **game development using Phaser**, but I plan to **learn artificial intelligence and machine learning** in the near future, because they are the technologies that **I would like to dedicate myself to** in the near future.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on **interesting and unusual software projects** where I can do my bit.
- ü§î I'm **not looking for help** with anything currently, but thanks for bothering.
- üí¨ Ask me about **math** and **science**, I think I will be able to help you in those fields.
- üì´ How to reach me: Just [send me an email](mailto:h3nry.d1az.b0rdon@gmail.com), I'll read it and get back to you as soon as I can.
- üåç I am currently living in the **Canary Islands**, a small **archipelago** located in **West Africa** that is politically part of **Spain**.

<br>

<h1 align="center"> Languages and tools </h1>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a lover of **exact sciences**, I am a great fan of the **Python language**, since it has all the packages that I need to work with my disciplines and they are **very easy to use and install**; so that makes my development experience great.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, **my favorite programming language aside**, I also like other great languages like **C**, **JavaScript** or **Haskell**, plus I've created my own *(esoteric)* programming language, so I guess I should also include it in the list of languages I manage to use:
