&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello! My name is ***Henry DÃ­az BordÃ³n*** and I am a fan of everything related to **science** and **technology**, from *programming* (as you can infer from my GitHub page) to *mathematics* and *chess*, disciplines that I love with all my soul.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a [small blog](https://h3nry-d1az.github.io/) where, to be honest, I haven't uploaded much content so far, but you can stop by and subscribe to be notified when I start uploading it (if possible, it will be soon). However, you have to be aware that the content of the blog is in **spanish**, as I am a native speaker of it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHcgIehZE12tL777Rx-hHgA) where I upload videos from time to time and talk about the aforementioned specific topics along with several others that I am also passionate about. It's also in **spanish** and sometimes I even bring innovative and well-worked projects to the channel, so I recommend that you stop by at least to watch.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also have a [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/h3nryd1az) that I rarely stream on, but I plan to increase the frequency soon, so feel free to drop by and follow the channel so you'll be in the loop when this finally happens.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, you will have all my **social networks** and **web pages** at the top of the page including those previously shown, I thank you in advance for visiting them.
